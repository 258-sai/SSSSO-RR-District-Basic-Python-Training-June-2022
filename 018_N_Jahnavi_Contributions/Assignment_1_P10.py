# # Zen of Python:A Pythoneer once wrote 20 aphorisms stating how one can write beautiful and clean code with Python. 
# Came to be known as “The Zen of Python”, these aphorisms exploded amongst Python developers.
# Tim Peters wrote these BDFL’s (Benevolent Dictator For Life, a nickname of Python creator Guido van Rossum) 20 guiding principles for Python’s design but the last aphorism was left for van Rossum to fill in.
#Till today, there are 19 aphorisms as Rossum said that the last aphorism is “some bizarre Tim Peters in-joke.”

# The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
# 
# Beautiful is better than ugly.
# Explicit is better than implicit.
# Simple is better than complex.
# Complex is better than complicated.
# Flat is better than nested.
# Sparse is better than dense.
# Readability counts.
# Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
# Although practicality beats purity.
# Errors should never pass silently.
# Unless explicitly silenced.
# In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
# There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
# Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
# Now is better than never.
# Although never is often better than *right* now.
# If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
# If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
# Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
