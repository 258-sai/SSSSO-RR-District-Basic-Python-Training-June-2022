result should be 6.
2) Given a name which contains first and last name, print the output in the following

If n is 5, the output should be 5+55+555 = 615
4) Write a program to accept a filename from the user and print the file extension.
5) Given a list of numbers write a program to calculate the sum of odd and even

13) Write a function that accepts a sentence and calculates the number of letters and 
digits.

addition, multiplication and subtraction of it. The result must be returned a single 
return call.
16) Create a function showStudent() which has student id, student name and marks as 
input. It should display all the data. If marks is missing it should display 75.
17) Write a script to read first n lines of a file. Accept filename and n as input from the 
user. Similar to Unix head command.
18) Write a script to read last n lines of a file. Accept filename and n as input from the 
user. Similar to Unix tail command.
19) Write a program to count the number of words in an input file. Accept filename as
